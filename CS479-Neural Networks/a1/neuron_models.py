    Creates a spike train (as an array of time stamps).
    
    Input:
    times_rates is an array or list of (t,r) pairs, so that the
        firing rate is changed to r (Hz) at time t (seconds).
        If the last firing rate is not zero, the last interval is
        extended for 1s, and then the rate goes to zero.
    jitter is a scalar that determines how much the spikes
        are randomly moved

    spike_times is an array of times when spikes occurred

             by 25Hz that starts at 0.5s and ends at 2s, use
